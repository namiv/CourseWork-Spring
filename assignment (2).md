## Overview
The purpose of this assignment is to explore how causal relationships are assessed between social determinants of health and health outcomes. More specifically, you will be reviewing how _maternal education_ drives _child health_. You will be responsible for understanding the details of their procedures, but _do not necessarily_ need to understand the statistical methods employed. In order to appropriately answer the questions below, you will likely need to **read the paper multiple times**. I suggest that you skim the paper to get a broad understanding, then **re-read the paper** to understand the details.

For the responses below, a paragraph refers to a length of **4 - 5 sentences**.

## Maternal education and child health: Is there a strong causal relationship?

1. What is the purpose of this study? Assuming that the authors are pro-education, why would they write such a paper? _(~1 paragraph, 5 points)_
_Answer_:::
The primary purpose of this study is to ascertain the effect of maternal education on three markers of child health – infant mortality, children's height for age and immunization status. It aims to question the long standing and popularized belief that infant mortality has a causal relationship with maternal education. The authors present a strong case for maternal education not being the **only** cause of infant mortality and poor child health since other socio-economic factors have been unaccounted for in previous studies. Assuming that the authors are pro-education, their intent in writing the paper is to point out firstly, that investment in women’s education is required but not just on the grounds of child health improvement and secondly, assuming that there is a strong causal relation between maternal education and infant mortality may result in development of public policies to mitigate infant mortality based on unrealistic expectations from mothers and may result in an increased burden on mothers. In addition to these, living conditions in a community might exacerbate health more than health-promoting behavior (through maternal education) can prevent and, in such cases, individual level improvement in health enhancing behavior may fail to translate into actual improvements.

2. Using this paper and _at least one outside resource_, describe the **causal pathways** through which maternal education (may) impact child heath _(~2 paragraphs, 5 points)_
_
_Answer_:::
The authors of this paper remark that education is linked to a family’s socioeconomic situation and based on previous related studies, maternal education improves child health by enhancing the use of modern health services as well as by improving favorable behaviors connected to child care which might lead to an improvement in child health.They also state that educated mothers come from high socioeconomic strata and that controlling for  socioeconomic status of the family is likely to attenuate the impact of maternal education on child health. Educated mothers also tend to live in more economically developed areas. Areas that are rich and powerful enough to have schools are probably also rich and powerful enough to have medical facilities (Palloni 1981).
John Hobcraft in _"Women’s education, child welfare and child survival: a review of the evidence, 1993"_  mentions how maternal education can have some overlooked causal pathways to infant mortality primarily elaborating on how educated women tend to marry later and to have their first births later – especially if this is beyond age 18, the women themselves are more likely to survive the hazardous first birth and the first-born child is also more likely to survive. He also goes on to talk about how educated women generally experience lower rates of maternal mortality, both on a per birth basis and as a result of having fewer children. Hobcraft also talks about the causal pathways that Caldwell, the author of the pioneering paper stated in his study -_"Caldwell (1979) suggested several pathways whereby mother’s education might enhance child survival- a shift from ‘fatalistic’ acceptance of health outcomes towards implementation of simple health knowledge; an increased capability to manipulate the modern world, including interaction with medical personnel; and a shift in the familial power structures, permitting the educated woman to exert greater control over health choices for her children **(Source: John Hobcraft: Women’s education, child welfare and child survival: a review of the evidence, 1993)**.”_ 
In summary we can state that education enhances the acquisition and use of health knowledge and services, family resources, which in turn affect the health of family members and preferences for child health and family size.

3. There are concerns about which children are included in the analysis. Describe _which children are not captured_ in the **survey**, and _which observations are excluded_ from the **analysis**. Be sure to articulate _how excluding these children_ could skew the analysis. _(~1 - 2 paragraph, 5 points)_
_
_Answer_:::
The study builds its case using data from 22 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in different parts of the world focusing on developing countries. These surveys randomly selected women aged 15--49 within each cluster- restricted only to married women in some countries and included all women of reproductive age in others. Health history for children aged 5 and under and anthropometric data for children aged 36 months and under was collected. Infant mortality analysed data of children born within 10 years of the survey date, height-for-age of children between the ages of 12 years - 36 months, and immunization analyses of children between 12 years and 60 months for whom the health card was available. Since analysis was being done segregated based on clusters, clusters with only one child was excluded from the analysis -  which makes sense considering one child is not enough to come to conclusions about the entire cluster. Children whose mothers had not lived in the present cluster since the birth of the child were also excluded from the analysis which biases the results of the study since parental migration plays a role in child mortality. Dead mothers and their children were also excluded from the analysis which accounts for an added selection bias.
While analyzing height for age, the authors mention specifically that anthropometric measurements are available only for living children. Thus, the omission of dead children in this case (as opposed to the previous case for infant mortality where  independent variables were compared for both living and dead child pairs) –results in the effect of maternal education to be slightly underestimated (since maternal education affects a child’s survival probability), the sample of living children overrepresents children of educated mothers. 
Similarly, for immunization status, DHS collected data on the number of immunizations received by children born in the five years before the survey and a detailed immunization record is available only for children for whom immunization cards are available. Thus, a large number of eligible children do not have data on the exact number of immunizations received thus stating that sample selectivity affects the analyses.

4. Prior to the analysis, it's important to understand the _descriptive statistics_ of the population that participated. Using data from **Table 1**, provide an _overview of the population_ included in the study, and _highlight specific statistics_ that you believe to be particularly noteworthy. _(~1 - 2 paragraph, 5 points)_
_
_Answer_:::
The study builds its case using data from 22 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in different parts of the world focusing on developing countries. The results are demarcated based on the geographic locations -  so we have three distinct categories Africa, Asia/North Africa, and Latin America/Caribbean. The population broadly consists of women aged 15-49 years. Information was also collected about their fertility history, maternity care, and some aspects of their socioeconomic background. In addition, a health history was collected for children aged 5 and under and anthropometric data were collected for children aged 36 months and under. The table describes succinctly the metrics of number of immunizations, the height for age difference and the corresponding level of maternal education in each country. 
Some noteworthy statistics are the percentages of uneducated women in each of these categories. We see that Latin America and the Caribbean have the lowest number of uneducated women (~20%) [and a considerably larger educated female population with almost 58% having received a primary education and 22% with secondary education] while Asia and Africa seem to hover around 40% and 50% respectively [with a majority population uneducated especially in Africa, however Asia seems to have a fair division of a 40% with primary education]. However, despite this the mean of immunizations is the lowest in Latin America (~5.9) as compared to the others (~6.8 and 6.4). This seems to be surprising considering that the authors report that maternal education is statistically significant for immunizations in more than half of the countries examined. African countries also have a larger value of height to age difference for children. Both Asian and Latin American countries seem to fair only slightly better in this regard.

5. The assessment strategy for this paper was to analyze the data using three different models. Each model was related to the overarching question, _"is there a strong causal relationship between maternal education and child health"_. Describe how each model attempted to answer the research question. _(~1 - 2 paragraph, 5 points)_
_
_Answer_:::
The study employs three Models – 1, 2, 3 wherein they try to examine the changes in the coefficients for maternal education as successive levels of controls are introduced. Model 1 works on variables - Mother's education, child's age, and urban residence; Model 2 adds levels of controls as father's education, presence of a partner, access to water and toilet. While Model 1 and 2 use OLS or logit methods whose standard errors are adjusted using the Huber procedure to take account of within-cluster correlation. While Model 1 echoes other studies when examining a causal relationship between the two variables, Model 2 shows results that include an expanded set of predictors as mentioned above. Since maternal education serves as a proxy for a family's socioeconomic situation, introducing direct controls for some of these variables reduces its effect thus weakening the argument of a causal relationship. Model 3 includes controls of model 2 and uses the Fixed Effects method which divides the clusters in each country into two categories: clusters with a high concentration of secondary education and clusters with a low concentration of secondary education. High-education clusters are determined by ranking according to the number of mothers with a secondary education. The top clusters are selected until 75% of the sample women with a secondary education are included. Fixed-effects models with the same set of variables show further declines in educational differentials weakening causality between maternal education and child health

6. Describe the three outcomes used for measuring child health in this study. What does each one of these outcomes capture about child health? _(~1 - 2 paragraph, 5 points)_
_
_Answer_:::
The study focuses on three dependent variables as markers for child health: probability of death within the first year, height-for-age, and number of vaccinations received by the index child aged 12 months and over. For all analyses the data includes births occurring 12 to 120 months before the survey and is divided specifically as per individual variables. This approach is a better way to measure the effect of maternal education on child health since these are continual measures and can record the actual progress of an infant into an emotionally, physically, and mentally stable individual. 
Infant mortality is a vital statistic in determining child health considering the first 12 months of a child’s care are the most intensive and require regular access to medical care. The height for age ensures that children are receiving the required amount of nourishment and proper exercise. Sex and an age-specific predetermined standardized height have often been used to reflect children's nutritional status. This variable reflects both food intake and freedom from chronic gastrointestinal diseases. Immunization status accounts for preventive medicinal care which affects not just the individual but the community at large -  especially for contagious diseases such as measles and mumps. Effective immunization also prevents medical complications that a child may develop later. The availability of the immunization card is likely to be related to maternal education. Infant mortality analyses focus on children born within 10 years of the survey date, analyses of height-for-age rely on children between the ages of 12 and 36 months, and immunization analyses are conducted for all children between 12 and 60 months for whom a health card is available

7. Summarize the results of the statistical analysis for _each child health outcome_. Your summary should capture pertinent information about the statistical significance of relationships, the number of countries in which those relationships were demonstrated, and the conditions (i.e., which model) under which the relationship was validated. _(~2 - 3 paragraph, 5 points)_
_
_Answer_:::
There are three primary child health outcomes covered under this study all of which have been examined by three models. Model 1 and 2 use OLS or logit methods while Model 3 uses a fixed effects method.
On examining infant mortality, echoing results from other studies, Model 1 shows a consistent negative relationship between maternal education and the probability of infant death. Children of mothers with a secondary-school education are the least likely to experience infant deaths followed by mothers who attended primary -school education and mothers with no education. Thus Model 1 shows a causal relationship between maternal education and infant mortality. This effect is statistically significant in 11 countries for primary education and in 15 countries for secondary education and jointly significant in
14 countries. Model 2 includes an expanded set of predictors. and introducing direct controls for these variables reduces its effect. Consequently, the mean of all coefficients over the sample set for primary education changes from -.181 to -.145 and for secondary education from -.703 to -.520. This effect is statistically significant for 7 and 13 countries for primary and secondary education respectively and jointly significant in 11 of the 22 countries. Fixed-effects models with the same set of variables show further declines in educational differentials and the coefficients further drop to -.153 and -.339 for both levels and a coefficient of -.153 reflects a 14% reduction in
child mortality with only 9 out of the 22 countries showing this level of reduction.
Height for-age is closely linked to maternal education in Model 1 with positive and significant coefficients in 6 countries for primary and in 13 for secondary education. The introduction of controls for socioeconomic factors under Model 2 decreases these coefficients. In the final model, the effects of primary and secondary education are small and are statistically significant in very a few countries. On average, the coefficients in Model 3 show a marked decrease from those in Model 1 thus reflecting a weakening causal relationship between Height for Age and Maternal Education. Maternal education continues to have a statistically significant effect on children's immunization status regardless of the inclusion of cluster-level fixed effects (Model 3) or other due to inclusion of other socioeconomic factors (Model 2) resulting in the effect of primary education being statistically significant in 9, and secondary education in 11 countries.

8. What are the policy implications of this study? Should maternal education investments be a strategy for improving child health? _(~1 - 2 paragraph, 5 points)_
_
_Answer_:::
This study attempts and succeeds in disproving a causal relationship between maternal education and child health and presents decreased education coefficients (however also finds them to be large for secondary education in Latin America). The implications of this study may result in decreased efforts towards maternal education and might mask the otherwise possibly positive effects of maternal education- firstly, better access to medical access and thus an improvement in health of children of the community at large in a community with a higher ratio of educated mothers; secondly, higher immunization levels for children of educated mothers may reduce the likelihood of diseases like measles for all children in the community, thereby reducing mortality for children of the community at large through spillover effects. These factors thus suggest that educated mothers may indulge in more health-oriented behavior. However, living conditions in a community might exacerbate health more than health-promoting behavior (through maternal education) can prevent and, in such cases, individual level improvement in health enhancing behavior may fail to translate into actual improvements. Therefore, before we rule out maternal education as a priority altogether, there is a need for further research and reevaluation of the available evidence before engaging in policy advocacy. Because investment in women's education is required for reasons other than child health, lack of critical attention may result in public policies based on unrealistic expectations from mothers and may result in lower levels of child health and an increased burden on mothers. This is especially relevant in the current approach where focus on primary health care is replaced by a focus on selective health care

## Complementary Research
There are many _distal_ factors like maternal education that impact child health. In this section, you should **identify another upstream determinant** of child health. Using at least **3 outside resources**, describe (in depth) another social determinant of child health. Make sure to describe how it intersects with maternal education _(~3 - 5 paragraphs, 10 points)_.
_
_Answer_:::
Child malnutrition remains one of the many health challenges facing us today. The problem of malnutrition has an impact on health, education, and the economy of the affected countries. Malnutrition is a major single and underlying cause of child morbidity and mortality in many developing countries. Nutritional status of under-five children is an important outcome measure of children’s health (NBS and ICF Macro 2011). Research shows that the level of resistance to infection is lower for malnourished children than other children, causing high levels of morbidity and mortality (UNICEF 2001). Further, poor nutrition also affects the cognitive development of children. 
The importance of mother’s education for child health and nutrition has been well demonstrated. According to Mosley and Chen (1984), maternal education affects children’s health and nutritional outcomes through its effect on improving women’s socioeconomic status. The various pathways through which maternal education promotes child survival, as suggested by the literature, include the acquisition of health knowledge, adherence to recommended feeding practices for children, and increased command over resources. One of the implicit assumptions in the promotion of maternal education is that improved literacy would lead to better health-seeking behavior and improved nutrition for the population. Modeling the effects of maternal education on child nutrition outcomes has focused on four factors: socioeconomic status; women’s empowerment and autonomy; health knowledge and attitudes; and health and reproductive behavior (Emina et al. 2009). It has been argued that literate women are more likely to be aware of the importance of immunizing children against diseases, feeding children at appropriate times and in the right quantities, and taking early actions against infant diarrhea. Educated mothers seem more successful at reducing the prevalence of diarrheal diseases, but their children seem equally at risk of fevers and coughs. Educated mothers are also generally more likely to use medical facilities for treatment of diarrheal episodes, fevers, and coughs. The debate is still inconclusive as to whether there is a threshold level of maternal education needed before reductions in child malnutrition begin to accrue.
A number of studies that use maternal education as a proxy for socioeconomic status both at the individual and household levels argue that women with more education tend to have better work opportunities, and they are also more likely to marry men with more education (Cleland and Van Ginneken 1988). Further, more educated women tend to live in urban areas, where they have access to better health and sanitation services. Hobcraft (1993) argued that education permits women to exert greater control over health choices for their children. More-educated women also marry and enter motherhood later and have fewer children. As a consequence of their greater likelihood of using health services, of avoiding high-risk pregnancies and of experiencing fewer pregnancies, they are considerably less likely to die in childbirth and thereby orphan their children with deleterious consequences. Women with more education tend to have smaller families, in part because of increased employment opportunities and better knowledge about contraception; fewer children in a family improves the chances that an infant will survive. More education also helps women make better decisions about many health and disease factors such as prenatal care, basic hygiene, nutrition and immunization—which are vital to reducing the leading causes of death in children under five. 
Thus, it seems that there is a fairly straightforward connection between child malnutrition and maternal education. However, this does not imply that only maternal education can solve the problem. Since malnutrition and morbidity is a community level problem, it is essential to have methods to improve access to medical care, clean water supply, sanitation and shelter in place to work in tandem with emphasis on maternal education and awareness.
